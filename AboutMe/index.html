    <h2> Ethan Mullins </h2>
    <p> Hello all! My name is Ethan! I can't wait to get to know more about you guys! </p>
    <p> My degree I'm going for is Software Engineering. </p>
    <p> I love to watch anime, talk, and play video games. Not too
        interesting but I'm always down for something new.
    </p>
    <p> I'm single but down for whatever since I'm still young.</p>
    <p> I don't have a job just yet since I just got here and my transfer request
        got rejected from Walmart. I'm curently looking for a job though.
    </p>
    <p> I really love the people at BYU - Idaho, everyone is alwasy there
        to help you and walk through any problems you're having.
    </p>
    <p> I'm taking this course because it's just one more step to becoming
        a software engineer! I've taken a class in highschool about websites
        so I feel like I'm ready for this class.
    </p>
    <p> I've been a memeber of the church since 2013. </p>
    <p> I love computers so if anyone is looking into getting a PC I love
        building them and I'm willing to build them for free so just ask
        me and I can help choose the parts and then build it. I also really like
        anime so I also really like talking about all animes same with videogames.
    </p>
